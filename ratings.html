        <p>This matters because companies can be forced by law to give customers’ data to intelligence agencies. Other known methods by which these agencies can get customers’ data include coercion, hacking, planting an employee, or simply asking nicely. I’ve used the term “intelligence agencies” to refer to any government agency.</p>
        <p>Note: I have considered “customers’ data” here to mean customers’ content/messages (data, not metadata). Wickr, for example, does cooperate with law enforcement agencies — as all companies must — but they can only hand over metadata because the content is encrypted (and they don’t have the keys).</p>
        <p>Red = The company has been implicated in giving customers’ data to intelligence agencies. This is proven by evidence.</p>
        <p>Yellow = The company has been implicated in giving customers’ data to intelligence agencies. There is no direct evidence, but the source is reputable.</p>
        <p>Green = The company has not been implicated in giving customers’ data to intelligence agencies.</p>

        <p>This matters because some jurisdictions mandate that certain systems must have surveillance access for governments.</p>
        <p>Note: While many American companies were implicated in the Snowden leaks — the PRISM program specifically — I’ve considered this for the app only. If they are part of PRISM, this is considered under “Implicated in giving customers’ data to intelligence agencies”.</p>
        <p>However, in saying that, I assume that Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have all granted government backdoors to their apps for intelligence agencies. But apart from Microsoft, there is no proof that I could find.</p>
        <p>Red = Confirmed. The app was specifically designed to enable surveillance.</p>
        <p>Yellow = It’s widely accepted that the app was designed to enable surveillance based on evidence from a reputable source.</p>

        <p>Many companies periodically publish a transparency report. This details what type of requests have been received from governments, how many requests were made, how many customers were affected, etc.</p>
        <p>Red = Company does not provide a periodic transparency report. (Or it’s not particularly useful.)</p>

        <p>This matters because companies often talk a big game when it comes to customers’ privacy. How often have you heard this after a data breach? “We care deeply about our customers’ security/privacy and have industry-leading security in place”.</p>
        <p>Red = Company does not design its systems to collect minimal customer information, or does not have strong encryption/security controls; or does not have a simple, readable privacy policy and terms & conditions. Or the company is known to cooperate with legal (or informal) requests for customer information. Or the company’s business model relies upon users’ data.</p>
        <p>Yellow = I’m not sure that there is a middle ground. I’ll write this if I ever think that it’s appropriate for an app company.</p>
        <p>Green = Company designs its systems to collect minimal customer information; has strong encryption/security controls; a simple, readable privacy policy and terms & conditions. The company is unable to hand over user data to governments even if asked. Likewise, the company is known to fight legal challenges to decrypt or otherwise hand over customer data.

        <p>This matters because “money talks”, as the saying goes. If the company or person behind the money is likely to have reason not to protect customers’ privacy, it’s important to know. This could be indicative of the company not doing as they say (Google, WhatsApp, for example) or changing their mind once they’ve onboarded enough customers from whom they can make money.</p>
        <p>Red = Funded by a company/person that/who is well-connected to, or well-known for, collecting customers’ data. Or they are known for collecting customers’ data or cooperating with the authorities when it comes to requesting customers’ data.</p>
        <p>Yellow = I don’t know if there is a middle ground. If there is, I’ll write about it when it happens.</p>
        <p>Green = Funded by companies/people that/who either have a vested interest in, or no obvious reason against, encrypting/securing customers’ data. They mustn’t be known for collecting customers’ data or cooperating with the authorities when it comes to requesting customers’ data.</p>
