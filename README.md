Original source code and inpiration: https://codeberg.org/kuketzblog/www.messenger-matrix.de. Mike's layout and reponsiveness are much better than my old Wordpress blog. Thank you to <a href="https://jeffhacks.com/">jeffhacks</a> for adding <a href="[https://jeffhacks.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/)">Bootstrap</a> and integrating it with Mike's layout.
