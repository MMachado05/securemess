      <div class="accordion-body"><p>I created this site to enable people to compare many so-called &#8220;secure messaging apps&#8221;. Likewise, I hope to educate people as to which functionality is required for truly secure messaging.</p>
<p>In 2016, I was frustrated with the EFF&#8217;s very out-of-date <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/secure-messaging-scorecard">comparison</a>, and hence I decided to create a comparison myself. Reaching out to various privacy organisations proved to be a complete waste of time, as no one was willing to collaborate on a comparison. This is a good lesson learnt: Don&#8217;t be beholden to other people/organisations, and produce your own useful work.</p>
<p>This site is&nbsp;not meant to be comprehensive; security is <em>difficult</em>, and a full review of each app is simply not plausible due to time, a lack of access to source code in many cases, and a lack of knowledge of development practices, and general cyber security maturity.</div>

      <div class="accordion-body">In order to consider any of the apps &#8220;secure&#8221;, you must trust the people behind their creation/maintenance. Each of the apps has one weakness in common: you must trust a third party (them) in order for it to work. Namely you must</p>
<ul>
<li>trust that they have no incentives not to protect your data,</li>
<li>trust that they have designed and implemented a secure solution,</li>
<li>trust that they won&#8217;t/can&#8217;t hand over your data to the authorities,</li>
<li>trust that the source (e.g., Apple/Google stores) from which you downloaded the app hasn&#8217;t modified it,</li>
<li>trust that the source code they publish, if they do, is solely what was used to compile the app, and</li>
<li>trust that there are no backdoors or security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, with every single app that I&#8217;ve assessed, you must trust their directory servers. These are the servers that ensure that Person A is really sending a message to Person B, and that Person C cannot intercept the message or impersonate either Person A or Person B.

<p>Each of our own personal threat models vary. If you&#8217;re sending messages to your mum about dinner, then the privacy of your data and metadata probably isn&#8217;t of that much concern.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">However, if you&#8217;re a medical professional, journalist, lawyer, political dissident, or even a politician, there are many reasons why you would want to protect your, or your clients&#8217;, information.&nbsp;</span>

       Message Delivery

    </h2>
    <div id="flush-collapseSix" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">Even though apps may have their infrastructure outside Five Eyes/Fourteen Eyes countries, they may still rely on USA-based infrastructure in order to deliver notifications to devices. Both Google and Apple provide such notification services &#8212; for Android and iOS respectively &#8212; that run on infrastructure in the USA.</p>
<p>I have to admit that message notification&nbsp;is outside my area of expertise. However, according to the <a href="http://support.whispersystems.org/hc/en-us/articles/217524107-Can-Google-read-my-messages-Can-Apple-read-my-messages-">FAQ</a> for <a href="http://support.whispersystems.org/hc/en-us/articles/213190817-Why-do-I-need-Google-Play-installed-to-use-Signal-">Signal</a>, using these services is necessary in order to provide a good user experience.</p>
<p>This is my understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neither Google nor Apple can read the message or message metadata.</li>
<li>However, Apple or Google can read the message notification data.&nbsp;This means that if you&#8217;re using iOS, Apple do know the frequency with which you&#8217;re sent messages, and they also know when you&#8217;re sent messages. It&#8217;s the same for Google and Android.</li>
<li>Apple and Google need to know to which device to send the notifications. Both Apple and Google use unique IDs (hardly surprising) in order for this to function correctly. It&#8217;s therefore possible that those IDs could be tracked.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Threema <a href="https://threema.ch/en/faq">FAQ</a>, it&#8217;s possible to use Threema on Android without Google Cloud Messaging (Google&#8217;s message notification service).</p>
<p>Wire can also be used without Google Cloud Messaging on Android. Update: <a href="https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/commit/1669731329bcc32c84e33035a67a2fc22444c24b">Signal</a> can now be used without Google Cloud Messaging.

      <div class="accordion-body">Yes. Even if messages and attachments are end-to-end encrypted &#8212; and hence app companies, ISPs, governments etc. cannot see the content &#8212; the location of developers and infrastructure (e.g., servers) still matter.</p>
<p>Can developers be coerced by a government to create a backdoor? Servers don&#8217;t exist in a vacuum; someone or something needs to connect to servers in order to update code. Can this mechanism be manipulated?</p>
<p>Who has physical access to these servers? Are they in a cage whose biometric authentication allows only the company access? Can datacentre staff access the servers? Are the servers encrypted? Are these servers in the cloud? Can the cloud vendor access the servers?</p>
<p>All these questions are important, because if the servers aren&#8217;t secure, governments <em>may</em> be able to gain access to message content. And these servers are under someone&#8217;s legal jurisdiction, which means that they could be seized or manipulated.</p>
<p>Five Eyes and Fourteen Eye countries are more susceptible to pressure from the US given their relationships.
