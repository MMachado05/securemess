      <div class="accordion-body"><p>I created this site to enable people to compare many so-called &#8220;secure messaging apps&#8221;. Likewise, I hope to educate people as to which functionality is required for truly secure messaging.</p>
<p>In 2016, I was frustrated with the EFF&#8217;s very out-of-date <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/secure-messaging-scorecard">comparison</a>, and hence I decided to create a comparison myself. Reaching out to various privacy organisations proved to be a complete waste of time, as no one was willing to collaborate on a comparison. This is a good lesson learnt: Don&#8217;t be beholden to other people/organisations, and produce your own useful work.</p>
<p>This site is&nbsp;not meant to be comprehensive; security is <em>difficult</em>, and a full review of each app is simply not plausible due to time, a lack of access to source code in many cases, and a lack of knowledge of development practices, and general cyber security maturity.</p></div>

    </h2>
    <div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">p>In order to consider any of the apps &#8220;secure&#8221;, you must trust the people behind their creation/maintenance. Each of the apps has one weakness in common: you must trust a third party (them) in order for it to work. Namely you must</p>
<ul>
<li>trust that they have no incentives not to protect your data,</li>
<li>trust that they have designed and implemented a secure solution,</li>
<li>trust that they won&#8217;t/can&#8217;t hand over your data to the authorities,</li>
<li>trust that the source (e.g., Apple/Google stores) from which you downloaded the app hasn&#8217;t modified it,</li>
<li>trust that the source code they publish, if they do, is solely what was used to compile the app, and</li>
<li>trust that there are no backdoors or security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, with every single app that I&#8217;ve assessed, you must trust their directory servers. These are the servers that ensure that Person A is really sending a message to Person B, and that Person C cannot intercept the message or impersonate either Person A or Person B.</p>
